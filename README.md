Data and source code for "Overcoming velocity broadening effects in magnetic beam encoded microscopy using a wavelength-resolved imaging scheme."

**Please note the analysis code here uses MATLAB version 2022b**

Hi there,

To use the main analysis script ("read_experimental_data.mlx") to analyse the raw experimental data in the study presented, please follow the below instructions;

Download all items inside of this repository. The pre-requisite .m files saved within the folder titled "prereq_echo_reader", the raw datafiles stored within the folder "echo run 2", and a calibration .txt file titled "phase correction shifts (echo run 2)" and place all items in the same directory as the analysis script "read_experimental_data.mlx"

on line 15 of "read_experimental_data.mlx", please amend the variable 'pathway' to reflect the directory you've installed the script onto.
